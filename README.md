# Momento - The Evil Productivity App

Momento is a productivity app with a twist—it doesn't just encourage you to stay productive; it forces you! Featuring an AI-powered nagging mom, anti-todo lists, and unconventional focus modes, Momento ensures that you have no escape from getting things done.

## Features

- Anti-Todo List - Instead of listing what you need to do, Momento lists what you must do (or else...).
- Focus Mode (But Evil) - No distractions, no mercy. Just work.
- Call Mom - Need extra motivation? Call your AI-powered Mom, and she'll lovingly nag you into submission.
- Unproductive Punishments - Stray too far from your tasks? Momento has ways to bring you back to productivity.

## Tech Stack

Momento is built using modern frontend technologies:

- Vite - Lightning-fast build tool
- TypeScript - Ensuring type safety
- React - Interactive UI components
- shadcn/ui - Beautiful UI components
- Tailwind CSS - Rapid and modern styling
